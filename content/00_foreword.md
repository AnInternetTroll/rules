This document aims to provide an overview of rules for speedrunning Portal 2 and its
mods. Most rules are universally applicable, however, every category will have
exceptions and/or additional rules. Every rule detailed in the "General Rules" section
below may be overruled within a category - for this reason, you should make sure to read
*all* rules relevant to the category you are running.

Also note that this set of rules is not exhaustive on lists of commands or more
generally on banned actions. If anything seems at all ambiguous to you or you're not
sure if something is allowed, please consult a board moderator for the category in
question. Lists of moderators can be found in the category's section below.
