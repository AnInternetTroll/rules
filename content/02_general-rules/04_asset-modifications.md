### Asset Modifications

We have strict rules regarding which assets are allowed to be changed from their 
defaults during runs, which (unless otherwise specified) are shared across all 
games and categories. These rules vary depending on the kind of asset being modified.

#### General Rules

Any asset modifications are subject to being grounds for the rejection or removal of 
any run on speedrun.com or the cm boards.

When assets are required to be submitted alongside a run, these assets must adhere to 
speedrun.com TOS and any other applicable TOS for wherever your proof of the run is 
being stored. Including video submissions.

Editing .dll files that are present in the files to modify an asset is not allowed.

If you have any questions about whether something is allowed or not, please ask.

#### Textures

Portalable surfaces cannot be modified for any reason.

No textures can be modified to provide any visual assistance, such as help with a lineup.

Textures can not be more transparent than their original texture, this tends to be seen 
most in light bridge modifications. The only exception to this rule is the player’s 
viewmodel for both the portal gun and PotatOS.

#### Models

Modifying models of assets is not allowed, except for both the world model and the 
viewmodel of the portal gun. The world model of the portal gun cannot be used to gain an 
advantage for any reason.

#### Particles

Particles can be changed only if it doesn’t require editing any of the game’s .dll files.

Particle changes cannot be used for an advantage, nor can they be entirely removed.

#### Resource

Resource files can be changed, but not to gain an advantage or to outright remove them.

Any resource file that changes how the menu is structured, or how they function is not 
allowed to be active during singleplayer SLA runs.

#### Scenes

Scene files cannot be changed, regardless of the reasoning.

#### Scripts

Script files cannot be changed, regardless of the reasoning.

#### Sound

Sound files can be changed, but not to gain an advantage.

Voice lines that are integral to the run cannot be changed, this includes but is not 
limited to: elevator dialogues, dialogues that control other aspects of the level, and 
dialogue that would otherwise make the aforementioned lines be delayed in any way.
