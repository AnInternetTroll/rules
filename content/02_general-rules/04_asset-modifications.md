### Asset Modifications

We have strict rules regarding which assets are allowed to be changed from their 
defaults during runs, which (unless otherwise specified) are shared across all 
games and categories. These rules vary depending on the kind of asset being modified.

#### General Rules

Any asset modifications are subject to being grounds for the rejection or removal of 
any run on speedrun.com or the cm boards.

When assets are required to be submitted alongside a run, these assets must adhere to 
the TOS of all platforms involved in your submission, including both the site the run 
is submitted to and any sites linked from the submission.

Editing binary files (including .DLL, .EXE, .SO, A.OUT, .DYLIB, or .APP) files which 
are present in the game or Steam directory to modify an asset is not allowed.

#### Textures

Portalable surfaces cannot be modified for any reason.

No textures can be modified to provide any visual assistance, such as help with a lineup.

Textures can not be more transparent than their original texture (be particularly careful 
of this when modifying the light bridge texture). The only exception to this rule is the 
playerâ€™s viewmodel for both the portal gun and PotatOS.

#### Models

Modifying visual models or physical models is not allowed, except for both the world model 
and the viewmodel of the portal gun. The world model of the portal gun cannot be used to 
gain an advantage for any reason.

#### Particles

It is permitted to modify particles by modifying game data files (i.e. not binaries).

Particle changes cannot be used for an advantage, nor can they be entirely removed.

#### Resource

Resource files can be changed, but not to gain an advantage or to outright remove them.

#### Scenes

Scene files cannot be changed, regardless of the reasoning.

#### Scripts

Script files cannot be changed, regardless of the reasoning.

There is an exception for changing `Portal 2/portal2/scripts/talker` to include
`taunt fast`. More information can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/146404426746167296/730456562337972248/1234878193299886221)
in the [P2SR discord](https://discord.com/invite/hRwE4Zr)

#### Sound

Sound files can be changed, but not to gain an advantage.

Voice lines that are integral to the run cannot be changed. This includes but is not 
limited to: elevator dialogues, dialogues that control other aspects of the level, and 
dialogue that would otherwise make the aforementioned lines be delayed in any way.
