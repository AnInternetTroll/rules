### Asset Modifications

Texture modifications are allowed, with some caveats. The textures of portal surfaces
must not be modified in any way. No textures can be modified to provide any visual
assistance, such as help with a lineup. No texture may be modified to be more
translucent than it was, with the exception of the player's viewmodel.

Modifying models is not allowed, with the exception of the portal gun (including both
the viewmodel and the in-world model). Modifying audio files, captions or any other
asset is not allowed.
