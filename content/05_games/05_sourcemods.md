### Sourcemods

#### Timing

- Timing begins when you have gained control of the player.
- The ending timing will be listed with the category.
- Exceptions will be listed if there are any.

#### General Rules

`Developer 1` cannot be used to make the player move early, any runs that used
developer 1 will be grandfathered in, and 1.5 seconds will be added per map where it was deemed to be an advantage.

Whichever categories are present will adopt their respective rulesets from the basegame categories.
